## Overview

This accessibility widget offers a comprehensive set of tools designed to help users with various accessibility needs, including visual impairments, dyslexia, ADHD, motor difficulties, and more. The widget is fully keyboard-accessible, privacy-focused, and has minimal performance impact.

## Quick Start

### Installation

1. **Include the CSS file** in your HTML `<head>`:
   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/accessibility-tools.css">
   ```

2. **Add the toggle button** (typically in your header):
   ```html
   <button
       class="accessibility-toggle-btn"
       type="button"
       aria-haspopup="dialog"
       aria-label="Accessibility options"
       aria-expanded="false"
       aria-controls="accessibility-panel">
       <span>Accessibility Tools</span>
   </button>
   ```

3. **Add the accessibility panel** (typically before closing `</body>`):
   ```html
   <div
       class="accessibility-widget-panel"
       id="accessibility-panel"
       role="dialog"
       aria-label="Accessibility Settings"
       aria-hidden="true"
       data-open="false">
       <!-- Panel content here -->
   </div>
   ```

4. **Include the JavaScript file** before closing `</body>`:
   ```html
   <script src="assets/js/accessibility-tools.js"></script>
   ```

### Additional Features

### For Developers

**Key Implementation Notes:**

1. The widget uses `localStorage` to persist user preferences
2. Theme preference detection uses `prefers-color-scheme` media query
3. All ARIA attributes are properly implemented for screen reader support
4. The reading mask uses mouse/touch position tracking with `requestAnimationFrame`
5. CSS classes are applied to the `<html>` element for global theme changes

**Customization:**

You can customize the widget appearance by modifying `assets/css/accessibility-tools.css`. Key CSS custom properties and classes are well-documented in the stylesheet.
